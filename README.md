# Pacman_Game
This is a Pacman game implemented in Java using the Swing framework. The project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts and basic game development techniques within a 2D graphical interface.

# Features
Classic Gameplay: Navigate the maze, collect pellets, and avoid ghosts.
Interactive Graphics: Smooth animations and dynamic game rendering using Swing.
Customizable Settings: Easy-to-modify code for game mechanics, layout, and difficulty.
Collision Detection: Functional logic for interactions between Pacman, ghosts, and walls.
Score Tracking: Real-time score updates as Pacman collects pellets.
# Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language.
Swing: GUI framework for rendering the game interface.
Object-Oriented Design: Game entities like Pacman, ghosts, and maze components are represented as objects.
